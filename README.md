# NM_AI_Email-Spam-Detection
PROBLEM STATEMENT
   
•	The problem of spam emails has been a persistent issue since the early days of the internet. Spam emails are unsolicited messages sent in bulk to a large number of recipients, often with commercial or malicious intent. These emails can be annoying, cluttering up users' inboxes with irrelevant messages, but they can also pose serious threats to security and privacy.
•	Spam emails often contain malicious content, such as phishing links or malware, that can trick users into revealing sensitive information or infect their devices. Phishing emails, for example, are designed to look like legitimate messages from reputable sources, such as banks or online services, in an attempt to deceive users into providing their personal or financial information.
•	To address the problem of spam emails, various solutions have been developed over the years. One common approach is to use spam filters, which are algorithms designed to automatically identify and filter out spam emails from users' inboxes. These filters work by analyzing the content and characteristics of emails to determine whether they are likely to be spam or legitimate messages.
•	Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for spam email detection, as it allows for the development of sophisticated algorithms that can analyze large amounts of email data to identify patterns and trends associated with spam emails. By training machine learning models on labeled datasets of spam and non-spam emails, these algorithms can learn to accurately classify new emails as spam or non-spam based on their content and characteristics.
•	The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning-based solution for detecting spam emails and filtering them out from users' inboxes. By reducing the amount of unwanted and potentially harmful emails that users receive, the project aims to improve the overall email experience for users and enhance their security and privacy.

PROPOSED SOLUTION


•	Our proposed solution for detecting spam emails involves using machine learning algorithms, a popular approach due to its ability to analyze large amounts of data and identify patterns that may not be apparent to human reviewers. Here's a detailed explanation of each component:
•	Data Collection:
•	Gathering a large and diverse dataset of labeled emails is crucial for training a machine learning model to accurately distinguish between spam and non-spam emails.
•	The dataset should ideally contain emails from various sources and in different languages to ensure the model's effectiveness across different contexts.
•	Data Preprocessing:
•	Preprocessing the email text involves several steps to clean and prepare the data for analysis.
•	This includes removing any HTML tags, special characters, and punctuation marks that do not contribute to the content of the email.
•	Stopwords (common words like "and", "the", "is") are also removed as they do not carry significant meaning in distinguishing between spam and non-spam emails.
•	The text is then tokenized, which means splitting it into individual words or tokens, to prepare it for feature extraction.
•	Feature Extraction:
•	Feature extraction is a critical step in converting the email text into a format that can be used by machine learning algorithms.
•	Common techniques include TF-IDF, which calculates the importance of a word in an email relative to its frequency in a collection of emails, and word embeddings, which represent words as dense vectors in a continuous space.
•	N-grams, which are sequences of N words, can also be used to capture contextual information in the email text.
•	Machine Learning Model:
•	Once the email text has been preprocessed and features extracted, it is ready to be used as input to a machine learning model.
•	Common models for spam email detection include logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), and naive Bayes classifiers.
•	These models are trained on the labeled dataset of emails to learn the patterns and characteristics that distinguish spam from non-spam emails.
•	Model Evaluation and Testing:
•	After training the machine learning model, it is evaluated using a separate test dataset to assess its performance.
•	Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are commonly used to evaluate the model's effectiveness in correctly classifying spam and non-spam emails.
•	By following these steps, the proposed solution aims to develop a robust and accurate spam email detection system that can effectively filter out unwanted emails, thereby improving the overall email experience for users.
